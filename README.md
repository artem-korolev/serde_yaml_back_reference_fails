# Example of serde_yaml usage, which causes an error

I found YAML quite interesting to use, cause I can export instance of my data
model from any language, and then import it to any other language saving all
references to all objects inside my data model. Sometimes it is very handful,
cause I don't need to use DTO template, or JsonIgnore, and then I need to back
reference needed objects again in imported data model.

But serde_yaml:0.8 is not able to properly deserialize yaml with back references.

To see this in action I prepared this project. Run it:

```shell script
cargo run
```

It causes runtime error:

```shell script
Error: RecursionLimitExceeded
error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\debug\serde_yaml_back_reference_fails.exe` (exit code: 1)
```

For bigger size yaml (about 5MB), it causes stack overflow. It should be the same reason anyways.

## Autogenerated model from json-schema

I use quicktype to generate data model sources in rust language (and others).
You don't need it to run this project. All sources already are in place.
Just execute **cargo run**

```shell script
npm install -g quicktype
```

```shell script
quicktype.cmd -l rust -s schema --out ./src/model.rs ./data-schema.json
```
